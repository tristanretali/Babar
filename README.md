## Setup

### Deploy local database

To deploy the database, you will need to have docker installed on your machine. You can find the installation guide [here](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

Once docker is installed, you can run the following command to deploy the database in a docker container, including phpmyadmin.

```shell
cd database
docker-compose up -d
```

Once the databae is deployed, you can access it at localhost:3306 with the user root and password s3web.

Once in the administration interface, you need to create a database named `shows` and import the .sql.zip file in it.

> note: you have to disable ONLY_FULL_GROUP_BY, this can be done in mysql with the following:

- go to the Variables tabs

- search label "sql mode"

- edit the content and delete the mode : "ONLY_FULL_GROUP_BY"

- save

NB: don't forget to verify the comma separator
